# Theory of Everything

Notes, articles and how-to's about Devops, CI/CD, Release Engineering and everything.

## Rules

### No placeholders

Don't create new pages to fill up with text later. Use [Issues](https://github.com/ci-team/theory-of-everything/issues) for that.

Every new page should contain at list three paragraphs of text.
